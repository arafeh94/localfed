# localfed - A Federated Learning Framework

This library is influenced by FedML. localfed is a federated learning framework that allows researcher to easily build
their ideas and run them in a federated learning context. <br>

Different from others, localfed consider federated learning as a composition of different components that should be
replaced on the spot without many changes.

Example running federated learning task

```
federated = FederatedLearning(params)
federated.add_subscriber(logger)
federated.add_subscriber(plotter)
federated.start()
```

This code will start a federated learning application with the given parameters and subscribers.

## Federated Parameters

FederatedLearning class requires different parameters to control its behavior. Of these parameters we can list

### trainer_manager:

Instance of TrainerManager interface defines how trainers are running. TrainerManager is followed by TrainerParams as
which define the training parameters of each client, such as epochs, loss, and so on. It exists for now two builtin
trainer managers:

- SeqTrainerManager that runs trainers sequentially on a single thread
- MPITrainerManager that runs trainers on a different instance, so it would be possible to run multiple trainers at the
  same time. using this manager would also allow us to control the behavior of the trainers, in terms of allocated
  resources for their runs since they are running on different process. such control is given because we're using mpi to
  complete this task. Refer to MPI Section to see examples.

```python
trainer_manager = SeqTrainerManager()
trainer_params = TrainerParams(trainer_class=trainers.TorchTrainer, batch_size=50, epochs=25, optimizer='sgd',
                               criterion='cel', lr=0.1)
```

### aggregator:

Instance of Aggregator interface define how the collected models are merged into one global model. AVGAggregator is the
widely used aggregator that takes the average of the models weights to generate the global model

```python
aggregator = aggregators.AVGAggregator()
```

### client_selector

Instance of a ClientSelector interface controls the selected clients to train in each round. Available client selectors:

- Random(nb): select [nb] number of client randomly to train in each round
- All(): select all the client to train in each round

```python
# select 40% of the clients to train a model each round
client_selector = client_selectors.Random(0.4)

# select 10 of the clients to train a model each round
client_selector = client_selectors.Random(10)

# select all clients
client_selector = client_selectors.All()
```

### metrics

Instance of ModelInfer used to test the model accuracy on test data after each round. Available metrics:

- AccLoss(batch_size,criterion): test the model and returns accuracy and loss

```python
acc_loss_metric = metrics.AccLoss(batch_size=8, criterion=nn.CrossEntropyLoss())
```

### trainers_data_dict

A dictionary of <b>[client_id:int,DataContainer]</b> that define each client what data they have. DataContainer is class
that controls holds x,y which are the features and labels. Example:

```python
from src.data.data_container import DataContainer

# clients in this dataset have 3 records each have 3 features. 
# A record is labels 1 when all the features have the same value and 0 otherwise
# A sample of data
client_data = {
    0: DataContainer([
        [1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 3],
        [2, 1, 2]
    ], [1, 0, 0]),
    1: DataContainer([
        [1, 2, 1],
        [2, 2, 2],
        [2, 2, 2]
    ], [0, 1, 1])
}
```

Usually we don't test model on manually created data. This example is only to know the structure of the input.
DataContainer contains some useful methods used inside federated learning class. However, to create a meaningful data
you can refer to data loader section.

### initial_model

A function definition that the execution should return an initialized model. Example:

```python
initial_model = lambda: LogisticRegression(28 * 28, 10) 
```

or

```python
def create_model():
    return LogisticRegression(28 * 28, 10)


initial_model = create_model
```

### num_rounds

For how many number of rounds the federated learning task should run. 0 used for unlimited

### desired_accuracy

Desired accuracy where federated learning should stop when it is reached

### train_ratio

FederatedLearning instance split the data into train and test when it initializes. train_ratio value decide where we
should split the data. For example, for a train_ratio=0.8, that means train data should be 80% and test data should 20%
for each client data.

### test_data

An optional parameter used for cases when the dataset have already specific test data to test the model accuracy.

```python
test_data = DataContainer(...)
```

## Federated Learning Example

```python
from torch import nn

client_data = preload('mnist', LabelDistributor(num_clients=100, label_per_client=5, min_size=600, max_size=600))
trainer_params = TrainerParams(trainer_class=trainers.TorchTrainer, batch_size=50, epochs=25, optimizer='sgd',
                               criterion='cel', lr=0.1)
federated = FederatedLearning(
    trainer_manager=SeqTrainerManager(),
    trainer_config=trainer_params,
    aggregator=aggregators.AVGAggregator(),
    metrics=metrics.AccLoss(batch_size=50, criterion=nn.CrossEntropyLoss()),
    client_selector=client_selectors.Random(0.4),
    trainers_data_dict=client_data,
    initial_model=lambda: LogisticRegression(28 * 28, 10),
    num_rounds=50,
    desired_accuracy=0.99,
)
federated.start()
```

## Data Loader

Federated Learning tasks should include experiments of different kinds of data set that are usually non identically
distributed and compare to data identically distributed and so on. That would cause researcher to preprocess the same
data differently before even starting with federated learning. To get the idea, suppose that we are working on mnist
dataset. Using federated learning, we should test the model creation under these scenarios:

1. mnist data distributed into x number of clients with the same simple size
2. mnist data distributed into x number of clients of big different in sample size
3. mnist data distributed into x number of clients where each have x number of labels (shards), by google
4. mnist data distributed into x number of clients where each have at least 80% of the same label

Different scenario could be tested, and generating these scenarios can take a lot of work. And this only for mnist
dataset without considering working with other datasets.

To solve this issue we create a data managers that can help to generate data based on the listed scenarios. It is also
capable of saving the distributed data and load it for the next run avoiding the long loading time due to distributing
data to clients.

### Example

```python
# label distributor distribute data to clients based on how many labels is client should have. 
# Example, distribute the data such as each client have 5 labels and 600 records. 
distributor = LabelDistributor(num_clients=100, label_per_client=5, min_size=600, max_size=600)
client_data = preload('mnist', distributor)
# preload will take care of downloading the file from our cloud, distribute it based on the passed distributor 
# and finally save it into a pickle file.
```

Available Distributors:

## Federated Plugins

Many additional task might be required when running a federated learning application. For example:

- plot the accuracy after each round
- plot the local accuracy of each client
- log what is happening on each step
- measure the accuracy on a benchmarking tools like wandb or tensorboard
- measure the time needed to complete each federated learning step
- save results to database
- add support for blockchain or different framework
- create a new tools that requires changes in the core framework

All of these issue related to the scalability of the application. As such, we have introduced federated plugins. This
implementation works by requesting from FederatedLearning to register an event subscriber. A subscriber will receive a
broadcasts from the federated learning class in each step allowing each subscriber to further enhance the application
with additional features.

Example of federated event subscribers:

```python
federated = ...
# display log only when federated task is selecting trainers and when the round is finished
federated.add_subscriber(FederatedLogger())
# compute the time needed to all trainers to finished training
federated.add_subscriber(Timer())
# show plots each round
federated.add_subscriber(RoundAccuracy(plot_ratio=1))
federated.add_subscriber(RoundLoss(plot_ratio=1))
```

<u><b>Important Examples:</b></u>

<b>Simple example:</b> apps/experiments/federated_averaging.py<br>
<b>Description:</b> FederatedLearning using mnist dataset distributed to 100 clients with 600 records each.

<b>Distributed example:</b> apps/experiments/distributed_averaging.py<br>
<b>Description:</b> same as simple example but using MPI for parallel training.Using MPI requires an additional software
on the host. Please refer to MPI documentation for additional information. You may find the command required to run the
script at the top of the script

```bash
# run 11 instance of the script the first one will be considered the server while the rest 10 will be considered 
# as clients, make sure client selector select 10 clients each round to benefits from all instances
mpiexec -n 11 python distributed_averaging.py
